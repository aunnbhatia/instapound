# instapound (1.0.0)
A Simple Python program to return Instagram details of a given user.

Its a simple cli project and user the awesome Instabot library.
The program can give a basic information for any instagram handle and can also give the names of followers and followings of 
the user.

As it user a third party library , it has its own exceptions. And can return multiple errors.
We are working to imporve the error handling of the Program.

Also we are soon gonna include a GUI version for better UI expirience.
We do not store any passwords but it is possible that the third party library store it.
You can delete the passwords in the config folder in the directory where you install the program.

Note: It is not an Instagram initiative and is an open source project ,
therefore using this program for false followers or increasing your insights can gget your account deactivated from Instagram.
